<p>The line following robot follows a black line on white surface. Its basic concept is that the line is detected using infra-red sensors and according to the signal received from the sensors, microcontroller decides what movement the robot should make. The infra-red sensors output signal according to the light intensity falling on it. Here, a black surface absorbs light more than the white surface The states of the photo transitors are captured by the comparator, and it produces a 1 or 0 based on this. According to the signals recieved by microcontroller (in this case, an Arduino Uno) which controls the car. When turning, the two motors spin in opposite directions. For example, if the robot needs to make a left turn, the right motor spins forward and the left motor spins backward. </p>
