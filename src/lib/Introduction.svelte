<p>The line following car is a car that follows a black line on white surface. The basic concept of the line following car is that the line is detected using Infra-red sensor and according to the signal received from the sensors, microcontroller decides what movement should follow the car. This line following car uses infra-red sensor that out puts a analog signal according to the light intensity fall on it. Here black surface absorbs light more than the white surface, this is the basic theory of detecting the black line. The states of the photo transitors captured by the comparator and it produce 1 or 0 for the recieving signal. According to the signals recieved by microcontroller(Arduino Nano) is controling the car. For turning the car a certain direction the opposite motor is turned off to allow a turn i.e if the car has to make a left turn the right motor is turned off.</p>
